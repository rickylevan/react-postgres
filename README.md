# React App with Postgres Backend

Working off of the great tutorial here:
https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-with-postgres-in-your-react-app

To run:

1) Start a local postgres server: `psql <db-name>`
	(should be running on port 5432)
2) Run the server: `node index.js` in the server directory
3) Run the client `npm start` in the root directory
